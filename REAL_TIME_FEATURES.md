## 🔴 LIVE Real-Time Updates

### Firebase Real-Time Listeners
The app uses Firebase's `onSnapshot` for instant updates:

**Hooks using real-time listeners:**
- `useEventState()` - Tracks registration status, current pitch
- `useProjects()` - Monitors all projects and bids in real-time
- `useUserData()` - Watches user wallet and profile changes

**What this means:**
- ⚡ **Zero delay** - Changes appear instantly across all devices
- 🔄 **Automatic sync** - No refresh needed
- 📡 **Live bidding** - See competitors' bids as they happen
- 🎯 **Instant leaderboard** - Rankings update automatically

---

## 🎨 Visual Real-Time Indicators

### 1. LIVE Badge on All Pages

**AttendeePage:**
- Red pulsing "LIVE" badge next to "Current Bids"
- Animated ping dot effect
- Shows users that updates are happening in real-time

**TeamMemberPage:**
- Same LIVE indicator on leaderboard
- Real-time bid tracking for team members

**ProjectorPage:**

## ✨ Flash Effects for New Bids

### Projector Page Animation System

**When a new bid arrives:**
1. 🟢 **Green flash** - Project card briefly turns green
2. 📊 **Scale animation** - Card grows slightly (scale-105)
3. ⚡ **Ping effect** - Animated overlay pulses outward
4. ⏱️ **Duration** - 1 second, then returns to normal

**Implementation:**
- Tracks previous bid counts per project
- Detects new bids by comparing counts
- Applies `flashingProjects` state for 1 second
- CSS classes: `bg-green-500`, `animate-ping`

## 📈 Smooth Number Animations

### Counting Animation System

**Features:**
- Numbers "count up" instead of jumping
- 1-second smooth transition (30 steps)
- Applies to all bid amounts on projector
- Math.round() prevents decimals in display

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Detects bid amount changes
// Calculates increment per step
// setInterval updates every ~33ms
// Animates from old value to new value
```

**User experience:**
- More engaging than instant updates
- Shows the "value growing" in real-time
- Professional live event feel
